The day-breaking blues signify his emotional range and clarity of mind that have brought him through it all.Cushion and ComfortA lightweight Nike Air unit at the bottom of the upper gives KD the cushioning and comfort he needs to thrive during a long season.High-Speed HavenKD loved the 15’s underfoot experience, so we took inspiration from the previous iteration and added a bottom-loaded forefoot Zoom Air unit for extra pop and snappiness when the game hits high speeds. Responsive full-length foam adds a soft, comfortable sensation.Groove and MoveGrooves and ridges in the sole help provide multidirectional traction and court feel. A stiff piece under the arch helps keep the shoe stable and help you smoothly transition from heel to toe.Broken-In FeelMultilayer mesh in the upper is lightweight and dimensional with a broken-in feel.
